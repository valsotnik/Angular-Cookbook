# How it works...

The `map` operator provides you the stream's output value, and you're supposed to return a value that you want to map it to.
We made sure that we converted the autogenerated sequential numbers to the array's indices by taking a modulus of the array's length.
Then, we used another `map` operator on top of these indices to fetch the actual element from the array.
Finally, we created another stream and used the merge method to combine the outputs of both streams and add this to the `outputStreamData` array.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
