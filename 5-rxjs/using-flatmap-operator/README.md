# How it works...

The `flatMap` operator takes the output from the previous Observable and is supposed to return a new Observable back. This helps us to sequentially execute our HTTP calls to be sure that the data is loaded according to its priority, or our business logic.
Since we wanted to execute the calls whenever a new user is selected, which can happen from the `UserDetailComponent` class itself, we put a `flatMap` operator
on the `route.paramsMap` directly.
Whenever that happens, we first set the `user` and `similarUsers` properties to `null`. "But why?" Well, because if we're on the `UserDetailsComponent` page and we click on any similar user, the page wouldn't change since we're already on it. This means the `user` and `similarUsers` variables will still contain their previous values. And since they'll have values already (that is, they're not null), the loader will not show in that case on tapping any similar user. Smart, right?

Anyways, after assigning the variables to `null`, we return the Observable back from the `this.userService.getUser(userId)` chunk, which results in executing the first HTTP call to get the main user. Then, we use a `pipe` and `flatMap` on the first call's Observable to get the main user, assign it to the `this.user` chunk, and then return the Observable from the second callâ€”that is, the `this.userService. getSimilarUsers(userId)` code. Finally, we use the `.subscribe` method to receive the value from `getSimilarUsers(userId)` and once the value is received, we assign it to `this.similarUsers`.

# UsingFlatmapOperator
